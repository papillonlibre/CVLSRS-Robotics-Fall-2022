Testing IP addresses. Note that these changes subject to whether the Pi is in or out of the robot
and also based on which WiFi you are connected to.

For future reference, this was run on the Tufts Robotics WiFi (TP_Link_Tufts-Robotics) using
the appropriate IP addresses. The robomodules were each run on an instance of PowerShell. The 
command to transfer the code from the local PC to the Pi itself was:

scp -r <FOLDER TO BE DOWNLOADED TO TARGET> pi@<IP ADDRESS>

The command to run each of the modules (note: classes that are not modules such as camera_reader.py
did not need to be run in this way) was of the form:


python3 <fileName>
